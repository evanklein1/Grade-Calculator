You need a " + x + "% in the REST of the course to get a " + desiredGrade + "% in the course

edit/delete a course - on update cascade not working

what about when there are 8 exercises but only 5 of them have been marked?

For the future:
--------------
duplicate button -> ask them how many and autoincrement the numbers
course weight (i.e. yearlong vs halfyear)
cGPA calculate


checkbox for if they want their school to be saved
school suggestions -> need to find some API for the list
handling case sensitivity for the school name
