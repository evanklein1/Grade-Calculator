# Grade-Calculator
Grade Calculator is an Android App that lets students enter their grades, marking scheme, and desired final grade for a course, and calculates what they need on the final to get that desired grade.

Users enter the marking schemes for their courses once, and update their marks for assignments and tests as they get them back. All their courses are saved when they close the app, to save them time from having to make the same calculations over and over.

Students can input their marks as fractions or as percentages. The fraction is automatically converted to a percentage when the user exits the text field, but switches back to the fraction whenever they re-enter the field.
